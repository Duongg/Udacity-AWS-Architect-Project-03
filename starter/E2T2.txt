Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project.
WebAppSG:
    - Ensure no security groups allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22
    - Security groups should only allow unrestricted incoming traffic for authorized ports
Bonus - provide recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities.
    - EC2 instances should be managed by AWS Systems Manager.
    - ALB should configure to redirect HTTP request to HTTPS request.
    - Delete inbound and outbound rules from default security group. Add the required rules to other security groups attached to the vpc
    - Enable S3 Block Public Access.
    - Ensure the default security group of every VPC restricts all traffic
